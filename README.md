# CMS Made Simple SQL Injection Exploit Python3 Conversion

Welcome to the CMS Made Simple SQL Injection Exploit Python3 Conversion repository, maintained by Chiranjit Ghosh, also known as "cyberchiranjit." This project aims to provide a Python3-compatible version of the original SQL Injection exploit script for CMS Made Simple, which was originally written in Python2 by the author Daniele Scanu.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to enhance the usability and reliability of the CMS Made Simple SQL Injection exploit script by converting it to Python3. As Python2 has reached its end of life and may no longer be supported by various systems and libraries, this conversion is crucial to ensure the script remains effective for security professionals, researchers, and ethical hackers.

## Key Features

- **Python3 Compatibility:** The original script by Daniele Scanu was written in Python2, which can pose compatibility issues. This repository provides a Python3 version that is compatible with modern Python environments.

- **Error Resolution:** Many users faced errors and issues while using the Python2 script. By providing a Python3-compatible version, we aim to reduce errors and make the exploit script more accessible to a wider audience.

- **Security Research:** This project is intended for educational and security research purposes only. It allows security professionals and ethical hackers to study the vulnerabilities present in older CMS Made Simple versions and raise awareness of the importance of keeping software up to date.

## How to Use
